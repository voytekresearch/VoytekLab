## Tutorials

We have developed a set of [tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/voytekresearch/spr) that we developed for a workshop that we ran at the 2022 and 2023 Society for Psychohysiological Research Conference in Vancouver, Canada. These cover the basics of the standard analyses related to the kind of research we do. For tutorials related to particular software packages, check their docsites.
